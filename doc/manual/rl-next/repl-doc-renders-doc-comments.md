`nix repl` has a `:doc` command that previously only rendered documentation for internally defined functions.
This feature has been extended to also render function documentation comments, in accordance with [RFC 145].

Example:

```
nix-repl> :doc lib.toFunction
Function toFunction
    â€¦ defined at /home/user/h/nixpkgs/lib/trivial.nix:1072:5

    Turns any non-callable values into constant functions. Returns
    callable values as is.

Inputs

    v

      : Any value

Examples

    :::{.example}

## lib.trivial.toFunction usage example

      | nix-repl> lib.toFunction 1 2
      | 1
      | 
      | nix-repl> lib.toFunction (x: x + 1) 2
      | 3

    :::
```

Known limitations:
- It does not render documentation for "formals", such as `{ /** the value to return */ x, ... }: x`.
- Some extensions to markdown are not yet supported, as you can see in the example above.
