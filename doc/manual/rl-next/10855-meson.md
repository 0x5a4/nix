These changes aim to replace the use of autotools and make with Meson for building various components of Nix. Additionally, each library is built in its own derivation, leveraging Meson's "subprojects" feature to allow a single development shell for building all libraries while also supporting separate builds. This approach aims to improve productivity and build modularity, compared to both make and a monolithic Meson-based derivation.

Special thanks to everyone who has contributed to the Meson port, particularly [**@p01arst0rm**](https://github.com/p01arst0rm) and [**@Qyriad**](https://github.com/Qyriad).
